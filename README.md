# Farkle

I brought some chocolates home a dispensory in Colorado this past Christmas and shared them with my family. They first hit me when I was beginning to play the game farkle with my parents, sister, and brother in law. That night, I came up with many great theories to try and understand the game. This reposistory is my attempt to follow up on all the crazy theories of that night. Create the game, determine optimal strategies, determine how different strategies fair against one another, etc. 

Farkle is a risk-management game. The simplest version of poker with dice. What I find so fascinated about the game is how the optimal strategy may include many risk-management strategies present in more popular games like poker, although it is quite simple.

**How to Play:**

```
To win at Farkle you must be the player with the highest score above 10,000 points on the final round of play.

Each player takes turns rolling the dice. On your turn, you roll all six dice. A 1 or a 5, three of a kind, three pairs, or a six-dice straight earn points. You must select at least one scoring die. You can then pass and bank your points, or risk the points earned this turn and roll the remaining dice.

Scoring is based on selected dice in each roll. You cannot earn points by combining dice from different rolls.

If none of your dice rolled earn points, you get a Farkle. Three Farkles in a row and you lose 1,000 points.

You continue rolling until you either Pass or Farkle. Then the next player rolls the six dice. Play continues until it is your turn again.

Example: Your first rolls shows 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, and 6. You keep the 1 and the 5 for 150 points. You then opt to roll the remaining four dice. On that roll you get 3, 4, 4, and 5. You select the 5 and decide to Pass and bank your points.

The final round starts as soon as any player reaches 10,000 or more points

Here are my notes from the night. I will use them as my guide for the project: 

```
Who invented farkle? 
  This game would be magic for someone in the 1700s
  Games measure intelligence! Games train intelligence. New games 
Farkle algorithm 
  Inputs 
  Outputs 
  Strategies 
How much more often do slightly better strategies win ? 
How would you identify common fallacies ? 
Common fallacies in farcle 
Things to consider about calculated the risks of farcle. 
Discrete math will help you solve this problem 

Other high thoughts:
The bandwidth of a game for intelligence. The too smart are bored. The too stupid, it is not game, it is life/randomness 
Human interaction is the game !!! That’s it, that’s what we need to maximize. 
The crazy thing is, the qualities of this game is likely far more beautiful than the original idea. 
Part of the game is learning it!
